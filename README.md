# Product_Page
Landing Page for a Product

##  I consider this as a more interesting project that I worked on, where I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and BootStrat.
## I found interesting and challenging trying to make the page responsive, which is something more I need to learn about.  
## Another feature that I consider interesting and I was glad to learn is the Newsletter Modal Pop up 
## There is still much to change and update on the page but the work I have put so far into it gives me a good feeling about what other things I could be doing if I keep the focus and the determation of learning more about Software Development.
